### Pendulum in 2D:
A mass $m$ at the end of a sturdy rod of length $r$ at angle $\theta$ will be released.
I will assume that the components of force along the tangential component $\hat{e}$ will be from the mass
$$
mg\sin{\theta} \approx mg\theta \text{ [small angle approximation]}
$$
and a constant damping force $k$ proportional to the tangential velocity $v_{tangent} = r\dot{\theta}$ angular velocity
$$
k * v_{tangential}
$$$$
kr\dot{\theta}
$$
This means that the pendulum experiences a "dropping" force along $\hat{e}$ of
$$
\vec{F}_{falling} = [mg\theta - k\dot{\theta}]\hat{e}
$$
